<h1>What is PaITuli?</h1>

<p>
  PaITuli enables downloading and sharing spatial datasets that are important
  for research and education. Data is available as files and as OGC web API services. 
  PaITuli's primary users are students
  and personnel of Finnish universities and polytechnics, but the
  datasets are open to anyone. Compared to other spatial data services PaITuli
  includes also historical versions of datasets. For many datasets the first
  version is from 2005, when PaITuli started. At the moment datasets from
  following data providers are available: Finnish Digital and Population Data Services Agency, 
  Finnish Food Agency, Finnish Meteorological Institute, Finnish Transport Infrastructure Agency, 
  Institute for the languages of Finland, Karelia UAS, National Land Survey of Finland, 
  Natural resource institute Finland, Statistics Finland and University of Helsinki.

  Besides datasets from governmental agencies, also students and personnel of 
  universities and polytechnics can <a href="opendata.html">share data</a>.

  Detailed list of available datasets can be found on <a href="metadata.html">
  Metadata page</a>. Datasets can be downloaded from
  <a href="download.html">Download data</a> page. Download page provides also
  preview to a big part of the datasets. The same datasets are available via 
  <a href="webservices.html">OGC web services</a>: WMS, WMTS, WFS and WCS.

  Metadata of PaITuli datasets is stored to 
  <a href="https://etsin.fairdata.fi/datasets/paituli?keys=&amp;terms=&amp;p=1&amp;sort=best>
  Etsin</a>. Metadata includes short description of dataset in Finnish and English,
  contact information, license terms and if available links to additional
  documents or web pages. Links to dataset specific pages in Etsin can be found
  on <a href="metadata.html">Metadata page</a> or on <a href="download.html">Download data page</a>'s
