<h1>Welcome to Paituli spatial data download service</h1>

<p>
  Paituli is spatial data download service. Paituli's primary users are students
  and personnel of Finnish universities and polytechnics, but most of the
  datasets are open to anyone. The service provides datasets that are important
  for research and education. Compared to other spatial data services Paituli
  includes also historical versions of datasets. For many datasets the first
  version is from 2005, when Paituli started. At the moment datasets from
  following data providers are available: Agency for rural affairs, Finnish
  Meteorological Institute, Institute for the languages of Finland, Karelia UAS,
  National Land Survey, Natural resource institute, Population Register Center,
  Statistics Finland, Traffic Infrastructure Agency and University of Helsinki.
